   <b>
   Important Notes</b><br>

   <p class="j">This is jGRASP version 1.8.8_21. Check
   <a href="http://www.jgrasp.org">
   http://www.jgrasp.org</a> for the latest version of
   jGRASP.
   </p>

   <p class="j">jGRASP is written in Java. Java 1.5 or higher must be
   installed on your machine in order to run jGRASP. The full JDK (j2sdk)
   1.5 or higher (not the JRE) from Sun is required in order to use the
   integrated Java debugger and workbench.
   </p>

   <p class="j">jGRASP does not include any compilers. The JRE bundled version
   and all other versions of jGRASP do not include a Java compiler. In order
   to compile programs you must have a compiler installed.
   </p>

   <hr><br>
   <b>
   Which JVM to Use</b><br>

   <p class="j">If you have downloaded a JRE bundled version of jGRASP, this
   is not a concern. Otherwise, the latest Sun JDK is suggested. When jGRASP
   starts, you may get a message telling you that jGRASP has known problems or
   minor problems, or has not been tested on your system.
   </p>

   <hr><br>
   <b>
   Installing from the Self-Extracting exe on Windows</b><br>

   <p class="j">Before running the installation file, you should close
   all applications. If a file from a previous installation is in use,
   the installer may give you a "Can not copy file" or "File in use"
   message. This would happen, for example, if you had the readme.txt
   file open in MS Word. If this happens, iconify the installer, close
   the file or the application that is using the file, pop the installer
   back up, and click <b>Retry</b> on the error dialog. If the installer will
   not run, you will have to <a href="#main_manual">install manually</a>.
   </p>

   <p class="j">On Windows NT/XP/Vista, if you have Administrator access,
   the start menu items and desktop shortcut will be installed for all
   users.
   </p>
   
   <p class="j">For a silent install, use the /Q flag. This will install
   in the standard location with a desktop shortcut and start menu items,
   but no new file associations. You can use "/D=install_directory" to
   specify an alternate install location. Note that there will be no test
   to ensure that jGRASP is not running when this flag is used. If jGRASP
   is running while it is upgraded, it is likely to crash.
   </p>

   <hr><br>
   <b>
   <a name="main_manual">Manual Installation on Windows</a></b><br>

   <p class="j">Unzip the distribution file in the directory where you
   wish to install jGRASP. This will create a jgrasp directory
   containing all the files. On 64 bit systems, add a shortcut or
   start menu item to jgrasp\bin\jgrasp64.exe; on 32 systems, add a
   shortcut or start menu item to jgrasp\bin\jgrasp.exe.
   </p>

   <hr><br>
   <b>
   <a name="main_osxinst">Installing on Mac OS X</a></b><br>

   <p class="j">Unzip and untar the .tar.gz file, if this did not happen
   automatically when you downloaded. You can use Stuffit Expander or
   from a terminal, "gunzip jgrasp*.tar.gz" then "tar xf jgrasp*.tar".
   Then double click on the .pkg file. A root password is required to
   install. The first time you run jGRASP, the CSD font will be
   installed on your system, and a soft link to the jgrasp startup
   script (for command line execution) will be created in /usr/bin or
   your $HOME/bin directory.
   </p>

   <hr><br>
   <b>
   <a name="main_osxinstmanual">Manual installation on Mac OS X</a></b><br>

   <p class="j">Unzip the distribution file in the directory where you
   wish to install jGRASP (you can use Stuffit Expander to do this).
   This will create a jgrasp directory containing all the files. You can
   then click on "jgrasp/bin/osx104/jcs" to run jGRASP. The first time you
   run, the CSD font will be installed on your system, and a soft link
   to the jgrasp startup script (for command line execution) will be
   created in /usr/bin or your $HOME/bin directory.
   </p>

   <p class="j">If you want to create a "normal" OS X application, copy
   the "jgrasp/bin/osx104/jcs.app" directory to the target location, then
   move the original "jgrasp" directory (the whole thing) into the
   copied "jcs.app/Contents/Resources" directory. If you don't want two
   versions of jGRASP to show up on the OS X <b>Start With</b> menu, delete
   the "jgrasp/bin/osx104/jcs.app/Contents/Resources/jgrasp/bin/osx104"
   directory.
   </p>

   <hr><br>
   <b>
   <a name="main_linsol">Installing on x86 Linux</a></b><br>

   <p class="j">Unzip the distribution file in the directory where you
   wish to install jGRASP. This will create a jgrasp directory
   containing all the files. You may want to add the "bin" subdirectory
   of this directory to your execution path or create a soft link to
   .../jgrasp/bin/jgrasp from a directory on the executable path.
   </p>

   <p class="j">Note that java must be on your system path in order
   to run jGRASP.
   </p>

   <hr><br>
   <b>
   <a name="main_insother">Installing on Other Systems</a></b><br>

   <p class="j">Unzip the distribution file in the directory where you
   wish to install jGRASP. All the functions of jGRASP will work except
   for the compile and run functions.
   </p>

   <p class="j">If you are on a Unix system other than Linux
   or Mac OS X, the first time you attempt to compile or run a program
   jGRASP will attempt to build the native "wedge" and startup shell
   programs. This may fail due to file permission issues or for other
   reasons, in which case jGRASP will use a less capable pure Java
   wedge. To build the native parts from the command line, cd to the
   jGRASP "src" directory. Run &nbsp;./configure&nbsp; and if successful
   run &nbsp; ./Make.sh&nbsp; .
   </p>

   <p class="j">Please contact us if this fails for some reason
   other than a C compiler not being installed or your system not
   being a UNIX variant.
   </p>

   <p class="j">If you are on a system other than Windows or a UNIX
   variant and have a good knowledge of system programming on your
   system, you can build a wedge based on the UNIX wedge sources found
   in&nbsp; jgrasp/src . The executable must be jgrasp/jbin/sys_run.
   </p>

   <hr><br>
   <b>
   <a name="main_admin">Network Administration</a></b><br>

   <p class="j">jGRASP supports common settings for all users on a
   network. The common settings directory can be specified at installation
   time if using the self-extracting exe on Windows. Otherwise, in the "data"
   directory of the installation, create a file called "admin". Specify the
   directory to be used for administrator settings in this file. This should
   be the only contents of the file, and not be followed by a line feed or
   carriage return. Use a full path to specify the directory. This directory
   must be accessible and readable by all users, and writable only for
   administrators. You should select a location outside the jGRASP
   distribution, so that you can continue to use the settings after upgrading.
   </p>

   <p class="j">When an administrator (anyone with write access in the common
   settings directory) runs jGRASP, menu items that allow you to change
   administrator settings will appear on
   the <a href="control.htm#ctrl_top">control panel</a>
   <a href="control.htm#ctrl_set">settings</a> menu. Also, when copying or
   creating <a href="settings.htm#set_setup_dialog">compiler
   environments</a>, you will have the choice of creating them for all users
   or just the current user.
   </p>

   <hr><br>

   <font size="4"><b>
   <a name="main_mci_fix">Linux Multi-click Interval Fix</a></b></font><br>

   <p class="j">Due
   to <a href="http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=5076635">
   Sun bug 5076635</a>, the multi-click interval time on many Linux systems
   is set to 200ms regardless of the desktop setting. This means that you
   have to double-click very fast or it will register as two single clicks.
   This bug affects all Java applications. The following paragraphs describe
   a procedure that will usually solve this problem.
   </p>

   <p class="j">Look for a file in your home directory named .Xdefaults or
   .Xresources. If one of those exists, open it up in jGRASP; otherwise, open
   a new file using <b>File</b> > <b>New</b> > <b>Plain Text</b>.
   </p>

   <p class="j">Add the following line to the file:
   <br>
   <b>*multiClickTime: 500</b>
   <br>
   Half a second (500ms) is a reasonable multi-click interval for most people,
   but you can use a different value if you like.
   </p>

   <p class="j">Save the file. If it is a new file, save it in your home
   directory as ".Xdefaults".
   </p>

   <p class="j">Shut down jGRASP and log out or run the following at the
   command line:
   <br>
   <b>xrdb -merge $HOME/.Xdefaults</b>
   <br>
   (or .Xresources if that is the file you edited).
   </p>

   <p class="j">Log back in and/or restart jGRASP. If the problem is not
   fixed after creating a new .Xdefaults file, try again using
   .Xresources.
   </p>

   <hr><br>

   <font size="4"><b>
   <a name="main_running">Running jGRASP</a></b></font><br>

   <p class="j">jGRASP requires a Java 1.5 or better virtual machine and
   system classes to run. You can get the latest JDK
   from <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/index.html">Oracle</a>.
   </p>

   <p class="j">You will probably need about 48 Megs of memory to run jGRASP,
   but this depends on the virtual machine, jit compiler, and which other
   applications you run concurrently.
   </p>

   <hr><br>
   <b>
   <a name="main_runwin">Running on Windows</a></b><br>

   <p class="j">The bin\jgrasp.exe file will start jGRASP in single-instance
   mode. Running jGRASP a second time will pop up the currently running
   instance. If you chose to associate file extensions with jGRASP during
   installation, clicking on an associated file will pop up the file in the
   currently running instance. A Windows application titled "jGRASP Control
   Shell", which initially runs minimized, displays the jGRASP output
   (including stack dumps if there is a crash) and allows the user to kill
   jGRASP if it locks up. It will first try a "soft kill", and if jGRASP does
   not exit within a few seconds, a "hard kill" will be issued.
   </p>

   <p class="j">"bin\jgrasp.exe" will search for a java.exe to run jGRASP in
   the following manner:
   </p>

   <blockquote>

      <p class="j">1) get from "-a" command line parameter if present
      </p>

      <p class="j">2) get from JGRASP_JAVA environment variable if present
      </p>

      <p class="j">3) check the registry for the current version of the Sun
      JDK if it is 1.5, 1.6, or 1.7 then the current version of the IBM JDK if
      it is 1.5, 1.6, or 1.7.
      </p>

      <p class="j">4) check the PATH for javac.exe - if found look for
      java.exe in the same place (avoids finding JRE before JDK)
      </p>

      <p class="j">5) check the PATH for java.exe.
      </p>

      <p class="j">6) check for the JRE bundled with jGRASP
      </p>

   </blockquote>

   <p class="j">The method used to find java.exe and the java command
   used to start jGRASP will be displayed in the <b>jGRASP Control
   Shell</b> window.
   </p>

   <hr><br>
   <b>
   <a name="main_runosx">Running on Mac OS X</a></b><br>

   <p class="j">Double clicking on the "jGRASP" file, or on
   "jgrasp/bin/osx104/jcs" if jGRASP was manually installed, will start
   jGRASP in single-instance mode. Running jGRASP a second time will
   pop up the currently running instance. Clicking on an associated file
   will pop up the file in the currently running instance. An
   application titled "jGRASP Control Shell", which initially runs
   minimized, displays the jGRASP output (including stack dumps if there
   is a crash) and the command used to start jGRASP, and allows the user
   to kill jGRASP if it locks up. It will first try a "soft kill", and
   if jGRASP does not exit within a few seconds, a "hard kill" will be
   issued.
   </p>

   <p class="j">The first time you run jGRASP it will create a soft link
   to a startup shell in /usr/bin or $HOME/bin. Then in a terminal shell
   you can run "jgrasp" and open files in an already running jGRASP with
   "jgrasp filename".
   </p>

   <hr><br>
   <b>
   <a name="main_runlinsol">Running on Linux and Other UNIX Systems</a></b><br>

   <p class="j">Similar single-instance mode executables exist for x86
   Linux. These can be accessed through the bin/jgrasp shell script, which
   will also pass the location of the jGRASP installation to the correct
   executable so you don't have to. A window titled "jGRASP exec", which
   initially runs minimized, allows the user to kill jGRASP if it locks up.
   It will first try a "soft kill", and if jGRASP does not exit within a few
   seconds, a "hard kill" will be issued.
   </p>

   <p class="j">On other UNIX systems, bin/jgrasp should run jGRASP
   directly, without a single-instance shell. See
   <a href="#main_insother">Installing on Other Systems</a> for information
   on compiling the native parts of jGRASP.
   </p>

   <p class="j">For the "java" startup script, if the location of java
   is not specified through a "-a" command line parameter or JGRASP_JAVA
   environment variable, then "java" must be on the path.

   <b>
   <a name="main_debugger">Requirements for the Integrated Debugger</a></b><br>

   <p class="j">For both the Windows and UNIX/Linux startup programs, to
   use the integrated Java debugger, "java.exe" or "java" must be in the
   JDK directory structure (in /bin, where tools.jar is in /lib), unless
   the "-cp" command line argument or JGRASP_CLASSPATH environment
   variable is used.
   </p>

   <p class="j">On Mac OS X, the integrated debugger will be available

   <b>Our Known Bugs</b><br>

   <p class="j">Interactions is missing some Java language features:
   static import, uninitialized variables (interactions locals are now
   initialized as if they were fields), generics.
   </p>

   <p class="j">Interactions does not allow the minimum long
   and integer constants to be used.
   </p>

   <p class="j">When running under 64-bit Java, file deletion from
   jGRASP will not move files to the recycle bin (a "permanent delete"
   warning is given), and J2ME installations are not automatically
   detected.
   </p>

   <p class="j">In the Java debugger and workbench, if a field
   exists in an implemented interface of the declared type of an
   object, and a field with the same name exists in
   the superclass but is "not inherited" according to JLS terminology
   (is declared private or is inaccessible from the child), the
   field declared in the interface will be shown as "not visible"
   (it will have a red bar through it), although it should be
   visible (jGRASP definition of "visible" is "available without
   casting"). This is due to Sun bug 6655791, but we may work
   around it in a future jGRASP release.
   </p>

   <p class="j">In the Java debugger and workbench, elements with
   replaced generic type are displayed with the replaced type
   (when known), but for "invoke method" and other operations,
   they are treated as the actual run-time type. Also,
   generic type parameters supplied when creating an instance are
   not thoroughly checked for validity, and arguments for "invoke
   method" or "create instance" are not checked for compile-time
   validity with respect to generic replacements or generic
   type parameter bounds. These problems don't limit the use of the
   debugger or workbench in any way, and they will be fixed in a
   future release.
   </p>

   <p class="j">On Windows, if documentation is viewed "outside of jGRASP",
   operations that should display javadoc documentation for fields
   or methods will only display the corresponding file (won't
   scroll to the field or method) for documentation on the local
   file system (Java library documentation on the web will work
   correctly). The built-in HTML viewer does not have this problem.
   </p>

   <p class="j">On Windows NT, a 16 bit Cygwin process that is run with the
   %CY or %CYD flag (console mode) can not be killed until the virtual DOS
   machine initializes and starts the process (which can take several
   seconds). An attempt to kill such a process will fail, but the process
   can be killed by closing the console, which will initially be iconified.
   This problem is not fatal and will rarely be encountered. It will not be
   fixed.

   <b>Bugs Caused by Java, Swing, or Window Manager Problems</b><br>

   <p class="j">These are difficult or impossible to work around. The
   eventual "fix" for them is (or will be) to get a newer version of the
   JDK. Many of them apply only to old versions of the JDK.
   </p>

   <p class="j">File chooser details view does not resize
   rows when the font size is changed under some JDKs (all file choosers).
   </p>

   <p class="j">On some JDK versions, the Help window will sometimes
   not come up, and a stack dump will be generated, the first time help
   is used. If this happens, help will not work until you shut down
   jGRASP and restart it.
   </p>

   <p class="j">Performance is bad and there is much unnecessary repainting
   with the Mac Look-And-Feel and Nimbus Look-And-Feel.
   </p>

   <p class="j">The help browser is not suitable for browsing the web.
   HTML display in Swing is limited and very buggy. The jGRASP help
   pages are constructed so as to work within the limitations and
   work around the bugs. This is somewhat better with newer versions of Java.
   </p>

   <p class="j">On some UNIX/Linux VMs, running jGRASP through the
   single-instance shell will cause the JVM to crash at shutdown. This
   seems to be harmless.
   </p>

   <p class="j">Memory leaks - due to Swing bugs, there are some small
   memory leaks. These have been minimized as much as was possible.
   This should not be a problem unless you run jGRASP for weeks without
   restarting. There may be larger memory leaks that we are unaware of.

   <a name="main_future">Future Features / Missing Features</a></b></font><br>

   <p class="j">Check the future plans page
   at&nbsp; <a href="http://www.jgrasp.org">http://www.jgrasp.org</a>&nbsp;
   for an updated list of planned future features, if you are not already
   there.
   </p>

   <p class="j"><b>Current Development</b>
   </p>

   <blockquote>

      <p class="j">An interpreter-like "interactions" pane that can
      process Java expressions and statements, and interact with items
      in the current debug session or on the workbench.
      </p>

   </blockquote>

   <p class="j"><b>Future</b>
   </p>

   <blockquote>

      <p class="j">More flexible compiler environments.
      Ability to run multiple commands for one "compile" or "run" item,
      add items to menus other than "Compile" and "Run", specify icons
      and have items appear on the toolbar.
      </p>

      <p class="j">Forward development features for the UML
      diagram (drawing, creating shell classes).
      </p>

      <p class="j">Navigation (for Java first).
      </p>

      <p class="j">More features for the integrated Java debugger: hex and
      octal display for values and array indices; a dynamically updated
      monitor display window, listing owning thread and waiting threads by
      monitor; automatic deadlock detection; byte code display; display of
      current watchpoints to make removing them easier; ability to set
      breakpoints without access to source code; repeated, counted
      stepping (eg: step in 42 steps); ability to disable/enable garbage
      collection for objects; assistance for memory leak (lost reference)
      detection; exception breakpoints; listing of all loaded classes with
      their fields and methods; show classpath, version, and other
      information for target VM; tracing variable changes; dumping of
      thread, stack, and variables to message window for easy cut-and-paste.
      </p>

      <p class="j">A debugger connection and interface for languages other
      than Java.
      </p>

      <p class="j">Unicode support.
      </p>

      <p class="j">Command line functionality for batch formatting and
      printing like UNIX GRASP has.
      </p>

      <p class="j">Add more compiler setups.
      </p>

      <p class="j">Have a project realize that it has been moved, and
      copy previous file settings.
      </p>

      <p class="j">Add an editor for user defined templates.
      </p>

   <p class="j">If you are having a problem with a compile or run
   command, make sure the command works from the DOS command prompt
   or UNIX/Linux command line before contacting us.
   </p>

   <p class="j">If you are having a problem with a compile or run
   command, clear the Compile Messages or Run I/O window, turn on
   "Verbose Messages" under the <b>Settings</b> menu, execute the compile or
   run command, and copy and send us ALL of the output. This will make
   it much easier for us to determine the nature of the problem.
   </p>

   <p class="j">Check the known bugs or future plans page at&nbsp;
   <a href="http://www.jgrasp.org">http://www.jgrasp.org</a>&nbsp;
   before reporting a bug or requesting a feature.
   </p>

   <p class="j">The preferred way to send a bug report or request a
   feature is using the <b>Report a Bug</b> menu under <b>Help</b>. Using this
   will send us system information (OS, Java version, etc.) that may be
   essential in helping us to track down the bug or understand your
   request.
