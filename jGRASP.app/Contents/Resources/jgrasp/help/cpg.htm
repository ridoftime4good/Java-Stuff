   <h1>
   <a name="cpg_top">Complexity Profile Graph (CPG)</a></h1>

   <p class="j">The Complexity Profile Graph, or CPG, is a statement-level
   complexity or comprehensibility metric. Each segment, which corresponds
   roughly to a program statement, is assigned a complexity that is a
   weighted sum of:
   </p>

   <blockquote>

      <p class="j">Reachability - the number of conditions that must be
      evaluated to reach the segment from outside of the enclosing method,
      function, or other top-level statement block. This is the traditional
      definition of reachability.
      </p>

      <p class="j">Content - the log of the number of significant tokens in
      the segment. Some punctuation, such as block-enclosing braces or a
      statement-ending semicolon, is not considered significant. A pair of
      parentheses is counted as one token.
      </p>

      <p class="j">Breadth - the number of statements, methods, etc. in the
      innermost block containing the segment.
      </p>

      <p class="j">Inherent - value assigned based on the inherent
      complexity of the innermost enclosing structure. For example, segments
      in switch or case statements are assigned an inherent complexity of
      3.0. This reflects the view that some structure types are inherently
      more complex than others.
      </p>

   </blockquote>

   <p class="j">The CPG window <b>Data Sets</b> menu allows any combination of
   these values and the total complexity to be viewed.
   </p>

   <p class="j">Currently, the CPG is implemented only for Java and Ada.
   </p>

   <br>&nbsp;
   <br>&nbsp;

   <h1>
   <a name="cpg_window">CPG Window</a></h1>

   <p class="j">The main section of this window shows the complexity values
   for the currently selected data sets. If the source is unedited,
   selecting segments in the CPG window will select the corresponding text
   in the source CSD window, and vice versa. The selection in the CPG window
   is shown as a yellow background. If the source is unedited, a black
   rectangle shows the segments that are currently visible in the CSD window.
   </p>

   <p class="j">Each data set value is scaled in the display, by the weight
   used in computing the total complexity, unless there is only one data set,
   in which case it is shown unscaled.
   </p>

   <p class="j">The label at the top of the CPG window shows the complexity
   values of the segment under the mouse cursor. If the weight of a
   particular data set is not 1.0, the value and weight are displayed.
   </p>

   <p class="j">The scale button allows the graph to be scaled, from
   two-pixel wide bars to screen-width bars.
   </p>

   <p class="j">If <b>Scroll Lock</b> is on, the CPG window and the CSD window
   from which it was generated will scroll as one. This option is not
   available if the source has been edited.
   </p>

   <p class="j">A scrollbar at the bottom of the window allows the CPG to
   be scrolled if it does not fit in the window.
   </p>

   </ul>

   <br>&nbsp;

   <h2>
   <a name="cpg_file">File Menu</a></h2>

   <p class="j">New - opens an empty CSD window for the selected language.
   Recently opened and currently open file types will appear under the
   main menu; other file types will be under the <b>Other</b> submenu.
   </p>

   <p class="j">Open - brings up an <a href="control.htm#ctrl_open">open
   file dialog</a>.
   </p>

   <p class="j"><a name="cpg_syncfiles">Sync All</a> - checks file
   modification times for all files in jGRASP with those on disk. For each
   file that has been modified outside of jGRASP, the user is given the
   option of reloading the file from disk. If the user chooses not to
   reload, the next check will report a modified file only if there is an
   additional modification. A save operation, however, will give an external
   modification warning even if there is not an additional modification,
   when the file has been modified outside of jGRASP.
   </p>

   <p class="j">Close - closes the CPG window.
   </p>

   <p class="j">Close All - closes all CSD Windows. The user will be warned
   and given a chance to cancel if modified files exist.
   </p>

   <p class="j">Save Data As - allows CPG complexity values to be saved in
   a straightforward text format.
   </p>

   <p class="j">Save All - saves files in all CSD windows.
   </p>

   <p class="j">Recent Files - allows recently closed files to be re-opened.
   </p>

   <p class="j">Workspace - allows switching the workspace and editing
   workspaces. A workspace includes the currently open projects and windows,
   as well as workspace-level settings. Workspaces in jGRASP are named
   rather than being stored in a user-specified file (as is done on other
   common IDEs).
   </p>

   <blockquote>

      <p class="j">New Workspace - brings up a
      <a href="control.htm#ctrl_new_workspace">new workspace</a> dialog.
      </p>

      <p class="j">Edit Workspaces - brings up a
      <a href="control.htm#ctrl_workspaces">workspaces</a> dialog.
      </p>

      <p class="j">Save Current Workspace - saves all the current
      workspace settings: the desktop, projects, and workspace settings.
      This happens at exit or when changing workspaces anyway, so this is
      provided only for protection against a crash.
      </p>

   </blockquote>

   <p class="j">Disconnect From Source Window - dissociates the CPG window
   from the source CSD window. A second CPG window can then be generated
   from the same source.
   </p>

   <p class="j">Escape Virtual Desktop / Enter Virtual Desktop - takes the
   CPG window in and out of the virtual desktop.
   </p>

   <p class="j">Raise/Lower - in the virtual desktop, move the CPG
   window to the front if it is not on top. If it is on top, move
   it to the back. Outside the virtual desktop, move the CPG window
   to the back.
   </p>

   <p class="j">Exit jGRASP - quits the application. If a compile process
   is active and there are modified files, this will not be allowed, since
   the old files are backed up before compiling, and restored afterward -
   this is not a concern if the <b>Auto Save</b> setting is checked (it is
   checked by default), in which case all files are saved before compiling.
   </p>

   <br>&nbsp;
   <br>&nbsp;

   <h2>
   <a name="cpg_view">View Menu</a></h2>

   <p class="j">Vertical Orientation - if on, the segments axis is vertical,
   and the complexity horizontal.
   </p>

   <p class="j">Show Key - if on, a key that shows the color for each data
   set is shown (if there is more than one active data set).
   </p>

   <p class="j">Show Axis Labels - if on, the segment and complexity axes
   are labeled. If there is only one active data set, the complexity axis
   is labeled with the name of that data set, otherwise it is labeled with
   "complexity".
   </p>

   <p class="j">Show Number Labels - if on, segment and complexity axes
   have value labels. The labels are evenly spaced based on a minimum
   inter-label separation.
   </p>

   <p class="j">Toolbars - allows the jGRASP interface to be configured with
   a single toolbar, separate toolbars for each window, or no toolbars.
   Windows that are outside the virtual desktop will always have a separate
   toolbar, unless the mode is set to <b>None</b>.
   </p>

   <p class="j">Toolbar Buttons - allows the jGRASP interface to be
   configured so that toolbar buttons show icons only, text only, or both
   icons and text.
   </p>

   <p class="j">Messagebars - allows the jGRASP interface to be configured
   with a single messagebar, separate messagebars for each window, or no
   messagebars. Windows that are outside the virtual desktop will always
   have a separate messagebar, unless the mode is set to <b>None</b>.
   </p>

   <p class="j">Menus - allows the jGRASP interface to be configured with
   a single menu or separate menus for each window. Windows that are outside
   the virtual desktop will always have a separate menu.
   </p>

   <br>&nbsp;
   <br>&nbsp;

   <h2>
   <a name="cpg_data_sets">Data Sets Menu</a></h2>

   <p class="j">This menu allows each data set to be turned off or on.
