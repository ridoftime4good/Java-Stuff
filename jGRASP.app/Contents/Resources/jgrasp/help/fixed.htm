   which triggers a "crash report" dialog in jGRASP. This may or may not be a

   New Features in Version 1.8.8_14 Beta</b></font><br>

   <p class="j">jGRASP can now run in a pure-Java mode, where no
   native components are needed. The downside of this mode is that
   some compilers and many executables will buffer I/O in this mode.
   This is not a problem when compiling and running Java though.

   <p class="j">There is now unbuffered I/O in the jGRASP Run I/O
   window for non-Cygwin-compiled user programs. Programs
