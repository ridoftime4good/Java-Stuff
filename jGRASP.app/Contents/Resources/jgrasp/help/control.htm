   <h2>
   <a name="ctrl_file">File Menu</a></h2>

   <p class="j">New - opens an empty CSD window for the selected language.
   Recently opened and currently open file types will appear under the
   main menu; other file types will be under the <b>Other</b> submenu.
   </p>

   <p class="j">Open - brings up an <a href="#ctrl_open">open file dialog</a>.
   </p>

   <p class="j"><a name="ctrl_syncfiles">Sync All</a> - checks file
   modification times for all files open in jGRASP with those on disk. For
   each file that has been modified outside of jGRASP, the user is given
   the option of reloading the file from disk. If the user chooses not to
   reload, the next check will report a modified file only if there is an
   additional modification. A save operation, however, will give an external
   modification warning even if there is not an additional modification, when
   the file has been modified outside of jGRASP.
   </p>

   <p class="j">Close All - closes all CSD Windows. The user will be warned
   and given a chance to cancel if modified files exist.
   </p>

   <p class="j">Save All - saves files in all CSD windows.
   </p>

   <p class="j">Recent Files - allows recently closed files to be re-opened.
   </p>

   <p class="j">Workspace - allows switching the workspace and editing
   workspaces. A workspace includes the currently open projects and windows,
   as well as workspace-level settings. Workspaces in jGRASP are named rather
   than being stored in a user-specified file (as is done on other common
   IDEs).
   </p>

   <blockquote>

      <p class="j">New Workspace - brings up a
      <a href="#ctrl_new_workspace">new workspace</a> dialog.
      </p>

      <p class="j">Edit Workspaces - brings up a
      <a href="#ctrl_workspaces">workspaces</a> dialog.
      </p>

      <p class="j">Save Current Workspace - saves all the current workspace
      settings: the desktop, open projects, and workspace settings. This
      happens at exit or when changing workspaces anyway, so this is provided
      only for protection against a crash.
      </p>

   </blockquote>

   <p class="j">Exit jGRASP - quits the application. If a compile process is
   active and there are modified files, this will not be allowed, since the
   old files are backed up before compiling, and restored afterward - this is
   not a concern if the <b>Auto Save</b> setting is checked (it is checked by
   default), in which case all files are saved before compiling.
   </p>

   <br>&nbsp;
   <br>&nbsp;

   <h2>
   <a name="ctrl_edit">Edit Menu</a></h2>

   <p class="j">Search Multiple Files - brings up the
   <a href="#ctrl_mfsd">multi-file search dialog</a>.
   </p>

   <br>&nbsp;
   <br>&nbsp;

   <h2>
   <a name="ctrl_view">View Menu</a></h2>

   <p class="j">Toolbars - allows the jGRASP interface to be configured with
   a single toolbar, separate toolbars for each window, or no toolbars.
   Windows that are outside the virtual desktop will always have a separate
   toolbar, unless the mode is set to <b>None</b>.
   </p>

   <p class="j">Toolbar Buttons - allows the jGRASP interface to be configured
   so that toolbar buttons show icons only, text only, or both icons and text.
   This applies to most toolbars in jGRASP.
   </p>

   <p class="j">Messagebars - allows the jGRASP interface to be configured
   with a single messagebar, separate messagebars for each window, or no
   messagebars. Windows that are outside the virtual desktop will always have
   a separate messagebar, unless the mode is set to <b>None</b>.
   </p>

   <p class="j">Menus - allows the jGRASP interface to be configured with
   a single menu or separate menus for each window. Windows that are outside
   the virtual desktop will always have a separate menu.
   </p>

   <br>&nbsp;
   <br>&nbsp;

   <h2>
   <a name="ctrl_proj">Project Menu</a></h2>

   <p class="j">Note that any operation that closes a project will save it
   first. It is not possible to discard changes to a project (unless jGRASP
   crashes or is killed).
   </p>

   <p class="j">Project operations apply to the project associated with the
   currently active window.
   </p>

   <p class="j">New - allows the user to create a new empty project or
   new J2ME (Java 2 Micro Edition) project.
   </p>

   <p class="j">Open - allows a saved project to be opened.
   </p>

   <p class="j">Close - closes the project.
   </p>

   <p class="j">Close All - closes all open projects.
   </p>

   <p class="j">Save - save modifications to the project immediately. This is
   never necessary, except to be safe against a crash.
   </p>

   <p class="j">Rename - allows the user to rename the project.
   </p>

   <p class="j">Recent Projects - allows the user to open recently closed
   projects.
   </p>

   <p class="j">Add Files - opens a dialog that allows the user to
   add files to the active project. This dialog allows files to be
   added with absolute paths or paths relative to the project file
   location (if the project is named and the file(s) are on the same
   file system (drive) as the project file). The relative paths are
   also platform independent. Using relative paths allows you to move
   your project to another location or system.
   </p>

   <p class="j">Import Files (J2ME projects only) - similar to
   <b>Add Files</b>, except that the files are copied into the appropriate
   directory of the J2ME project.
   </p>

   <p class="j">Remove Selected Files From Project - remove any files
   selected in the <a href="#ctrl_projwin">project window</a>. Also
   removes any project documentation corresponding to Java source files
   that are removed.
   </p>

   <p class="j">Generate/Update UML Class Diagram - Brings up
   a <a href="uml.htm#uml_umlwin">UML window</a> for the project and updates
   the <a href="uml.htm#uml_top">UML diagram</a>.
   </p>

   <p class="j">Generate Documentation - brings up a dialog
   that allows the user to <a href="#ctrl_doc_generate">
   generate project documentation</a> for Java.
   </p>

   <p class="j">Show Documentation - displays the documentation
   for the active project, if any. Currently, only Java
   documentation is supported.
   </p>

   <p class="j">Create MIDlet Package (JAR/JAD) - brings up a dialog for
   creating a JAR/JAD package for a J2ME project.
   </p>

   <p class="j">Create Jar File for Project - brings up
   a <a href="jar.htm#jar_create">jar creation dialog</a> for the project.
   </p>

   <p class="j">Jar/Zip Extractor - brings up a <a href="jar.htm#jar_extract">
   jar/zip extractor dialog</a>.
   </p>

   <br>&nbsp;
   <br>&nbsp;

   <h2>
   <a name="ctrl_set">Settings Menu</a></h2>

   <p class="j">Desktop - settings that deal with the appearance and
   functionality of the desktop.
   </p>

   <blockquote>

      <p class="j">Virtual Desktop - turns the virtual
      desktop on and off. If it is off, all CSD windows, the UML window,
      and all CPG windows will be top-level windows. If it is on, these
      windows can be moved in and out of the virtual desktop
      individually (<b>Escape Desktop</b> or <b>Enter Desktop</b> is under the
      <b>File</b> menu on each of these windows). When the desktop is turned
      on, all CSD windows are moved onto the desktop, regardless of
      their states at the time it was turned off.
      </p>

      <p class="j">Full-Height Tab Pane - if checked, the
      tab pane on the left side of the Control Panel will extend to the
      bottom of the Control Panel when the virtual desktop is on. This
      gives more height to the debug window, etc, and less width to the
      messages. You can also use the leftmost icon on the control panel
      message bar to switch between these modes.
      </p>

      <p class="j">Open Desktop Windows Maximized - if on, any window
      opened in the virtual desktop will be initially maximized. You can
      also use the rightmost icon on the control panel message bar to toggle
      this feature.
      </p>

      <p class="j">Focus Follows Mouse - when on, you can set keyboard focus
      to CSD windows and most other text-entry windows in the virtual desktop
      by moving the mouse over them. Unfortunately, using the mouse in a CSD
      window on the virtual desktop will still raise it to the top, but you
      can type and use keyboard accelerators in a non-top-level window.
      </p>

   </blockquote>

   <p class="j">Auto Save - if on, modified files are saved before a compile
   operation. Otherwise, modified files are temporarily saved before a compile
   operation, while the on-disk versions are backed up before, and restored
   after, the operation.
   </p>

   <p class="j">Verify on Save - if on, files will be verified after saving.
   That is, they will be read back in and compared to that data that was
   written.
   </p>

   <p class="j">Auto Sync - if on, file modification times will be checked
   every time the control panel is activated. You would almost certainly not
   want this on if you are in a focus-follows-mouse environment (if you are
   using Windows, you are not in a focus-follows-mouse environment). See
   <a href="#ctrl_syncfiles">Sync All</a>.
   </p>

   <p class="j">Verbose Messages - if on, compile, run, and CSD
   generation functions will give detailed messages about their
   operation. You can also use the middle icon on the control panel
   message bar to switch between verbose and short message modes.
   </p>

   <p class="j">Documentation Settings - brings up a dialog that
   allows the user to change settings related to the display of
   documentation. This contains the following settings:
   </p>

   <blockquote>

      <p class="j">Show Documentation Outside jGRASP -
      if on, display of javadoc documentation for the Java API and
      user classes will be in the default system browser (Netscape
      on systems that don't have a default browser). On Windows,
      link targets within a local html file will not be followed in
      that case. That will be fixed in a future release.
      </p>

      <p class="j">Java API Documentation Root - specifies the URL
      at which to search for Java API documentation. The path should
      end at the "api" directory. Because of major changes made to
      the Java APIs in Java 1.5, if you are developing under
      pre-Java 1.5, you should set this to Java 1.4 api documentation.
      </p>

   </blockquote>

   <p class="j">Colors - opens a <a href="settings.htm#set_csdwin">CSD
   settings dialog </a>for the workspace, project, or file settings, and
   selects the <b>Colors</b> tab, which allows changing colors for each token
   type in the CSD and message windows, as well as the CSD window background
   color and CSD color.
   </p>

   <p class="j">Font - opens a <a href="settings.htm#set_csdwin">CSD
   settings dialog </a>for the workspace, project, or file settings, and
   selects the <b>Font</b> tab, which allows changing the bold and italic state
   of the font for each token type in the CSD and message windows, as well
   the font, font encoding, CSD and message window font sizes, and global
   font scale.
   </p>

   <p class="j">CSD Window Settings
   </p>

   <blockquote>

      <p class="j">Workspace - opens a <a href="settings.htm#set_csdwin">CSD
      settings dialog </a>for the workspace settings, and selects the
      <b>CSD</b> tab, which has settings that change CSD generation and
      editing properties.
      </p>

      <p class="j">Project - opens a <a href="settings.htm#set_csdwin">CSD
      settings dialog </a>for the project settings, and selects the
      <b>CSD</b> tab, which has settings that change CSD generation and
      editing properties.
      </p>

      <p class="j">File - opens a <a href="settings.htm#set_csdwin">CSD
      settings dialog </a>for the file settings, and selects the <b>CSD</b>
      tab, which has settings that change CSD generation and editing
      properties.
      </p>

      <p class="j">Auto Generate CSD - if on, a CSD is generated at load time,
      after a template is inserted, etc. This setting applies to all CSD
      windows.
      </p>

      <p class="j">CSD Context Hints - if on, show
      <a href="csdwin.htm#csd_hints">CSD context hints</a> in CSD Windows.
      </p>

      <p class="j">CSD Window Popup Menu Enabled - when on, there will be a
      popup editing menu for CSD windows. The particular mouse event that
      triggers the popup is determined by the JVM and Look-And-Feel. On
      Windows, Solaris, and Linux JVMs, the event is generally any right
      mouse click. Turning this off allows you to use the CSD window right
      click function that selects tokens with one click, and levels of
      enclosing braces with more clicks (CTRL-left_click does the same thing).
      </p>

   </blockquote>

   <p class="j">Compiler Settings - opens
   a <a href="settings.htm#set_csdwin">CSD settings dialog </a>for the
   workspace, project, or file settings, and selects the <b>Compiler</b>
   tab, which allows changing and editing compiler environments.
   </p>

   <p class="j">PATH / CLASSPATH - opens
   a <a href="settings.htm#set_csdwin">CSD settings dialog </a>for the
   workspace or project settings, and selects the <b>PATH</b> tab, which
   allows changing the PATH and CLASSPATH for compiling and running.
   </p>

   <p class="j">Print Settings - opens
   a <a href="settings.htm#set_print">print settings dialog</a> for the
   workspace, project, or file print settings.
   </p>

   <p class="j">Java Debug Settings - opens a dialog that allows changing the
   properties of the integrated Java debugger.
   </p>

   <p class="j">J2ME Settings - opens a dialog that allows changing the
   global settings that apply to J2ME projects.
   </p>

   <p class="j">Administrator CSD Window Settings (Administrator Only) -
   opens a <a href="settings.htm#set_csdwin">CSD settings dialog </a>for the
   administrator settings, and selects the <b>CSD</b> tab, which has settings
   that change CSD generation and editing properties.
   </p>

   <p class="j">Administrator Compiler Settings (Administrator Only) -
   opens a <a href="settings.htm#set_csdwin">CSD settings dialog </a>for the
   administrator settings, and selects the <b>Compiler</b> tab, which allows

   <p class="j">Administrator Print Settings (Administrator Only) - opens
   a <a href="settings.htm#set_print">print settings dialog</a> for the
   administrator print settings.
   </p>

   <p class="j">jGRASP Startup Settings (Windows Only) - allows the user to
   choose which "java" is used to run jGRASP, the maximum memory available
   to jGRASP, and other startup settings. These will take effect the next
   time jGRASP is started. Note that the "java" used to run jGRASP is not
   necessarily the same one used to compile and run Java programs. To change
   the "java" used for compiling and running programs, use <b>Settings</b> >
   <b>PATH / CLASSPATH</b>.
   </p>

   <p class="j">Look And Feel - allows the look and feel to be changed.
   After a change, the color, size, and alignment of some interface elements
   may be slightly off due to Swing bugs in some versions of Java.
   </p>

   <p class="j">Check for New Version - allows the user to select how often
   jGRASP will check to see if a new version is available for download.
   Checking is done only if internet access is available.
   </p>

   <br>&nbsp;
   <br>&nbsp;

   <h2>
   <a name="ctrl_tools">Tools Menu</a></h2>

   <p class="j">Regular Expression Tester - pops up a testing tool for
   Java regular expressions, which are used in compiler error formats.
   </p>

   <p class="j">System Info - Displays information about the operating
   system and Java version under which jGRASP is running.
   </p>

   <p class="j">Run Garbage Collector - frees unused memory (in jGRASP
   itself) immediately on most systems.
   </p>

   <p class="j">Reload Plugins - reloads the debugger viewers and tool
   plugins. In a future version of jGRASP, APIs will be provided so that
   users can easily develop their own viewers and tool plugins.
   This function will cause those plugins to be reloaded after changes
   are made, so that plugins can be modified and tested while jGRASP
   is running.
   </p>

   <p class="j">Compile Multiple Java Files - brings up a dialog that allows
   compiling a group of Java files.
   </p>

   <p class="j">Close All Windows - closes all open CSD windows, UML windows,
   and CPG windows.
   </p>

   <p class="j">The rest of the items represent currently open CSD windows,
   and allow the user to pop them up. An asterisk following a file name
   indicates that it is modified.
   </p>

   <br>&nbsp;
   <br>&nbsp;

   <h2>
   <a name="ctrl_open">Open File Dialog</a></h2>

   <p class="j">A dialog for opening files.
   </p>

   <p class="j">Filters for the languages supported by jGRASP are provided,
   as well as the "all files" filter. Note that language filters classify
   files based on the extension only if they have not been opened in jGRASP
   before. Once a file is opened, jGRASP remembers that language. The default
   language for files with a ".h" extension can be set to C++ or C only (not
   both) by changing the extension settings for C or C++
   (see <a href="settings.htm#set_top">settings</a>).
   </p>

   <p class="j">You can also type a list of extensions into the <b>Filter
   Extensions</b> field to filter by extensions. These must be separated by
   whitespace, and can start with ".", "*.", or nothing. For
   example: "*.c *.cpp", ".c .cpp", and "c cpp" will all show only files that
   end in ".c" or ".cpp". Note that you can do the same
   thing by entering filter expressions in the <b>File Name</b> field, such as
   "*.c" or "*.c|*.cpp" .
   </p>

   <p class="j">The language may be forced at load time using the language
   pulldown menu. This only applies to files that have not been previously
   opened in jGRASP. Once a file is opened, its language is remembered.
   </p>

   <p class="j">The Text / Binary radio buttons allow the file to be opened
   in text mode (UNIX, DOS, and Mac. line terminators accepted) or binary
   mode (only newlines are line terminators).
   </p>

   <p class="j">To conveniently open multiple files, click on the "pin" icon
   to keep the dialog up.
   </p>

   <p class="j">To change to the current directory of the jGRASP <b>Browse</b>
   window, click on the folder icon with the "B" in it.
   </p>

   <br>&nbsp;
   <br>&nbsp;

   <h2>
   <a name="ctrl_browse">Browse Window</a></h2>

   <p class="j">This window, which is located on the <b>Browse</b> tab, acts
   as a file browser.
   </p>

   <p class="j">A combo box shows the current directory and has a list of
   file system roots. You can type a new directory in directly and hit
   "Enter" to change to that directory.
   </p>

   <p class="j">The Bookmarks menu displays bookmarks, and allows bookmarking
   the current directory and editing bookmarks.
   </p>

   <p class="j">Filters for the languages supported by jGRASP are provided,
   as well as the "all files" filter. Note that language filters classify
   files based on the extension only if they have not been opened in jGRASP
   before. Once a file is opened, jGRASP remembers that language. The
   default language for files with a ".h" extension can be set to C++ or C
   only (not both) by changing the extension settings for C or C++
   (see <a href="settings.htm#set_top">settings</a>).

   pulldown and hit "Enter" to filter by extensions. These must be separated
   by whitespace, and can start with ".", "*.", or nothing. For
   example: "*.c *.cpp", ".c .cpp", and "c cpp" will all show only files that
   end in ".c" or ".cpp".
   </p>

   <p class="j">Clicking on a file will open it (in text mode).
   HTML files will be opened in the jGRASP help browser, and jar files
   in the jar/zip extractor. To edit one of these files, you can drag it onto
   the virtual desktop or use the context menu to open it.
   </p>

   <p class="j">Clicking on a project will attempt to open it. If it does not
   appear to be a jGRASP project, it will be opened as a file.
   </p>

   <p class="j">A context menu allows selected files to be opened (in text or
   binary mode), selected files to be deleted, selected files to be added to
   the active project with either relative (to the project file location)
   or absolute paths, or the properties of selected files to be displayed.

   <p class="j">Color settings for these pages use CSD color settings. Some
   of these are specific to the message pages. They can be set on
   the <a href="settings.htm#set_top">CSD window settings</a>
   <a href="settings.htm#set_csd">CSD</a> page.
   </p>

   <p class="j">Clicking on an error in a message window will open the file
   referred to in the message (if not already open) and select the line
   referred to in the message. Clicking on a line from a Java stack dump
   in the Run I/O window will do the same. If line numbers are frozen in the
   CSD window, the frozen line number will be selected. Clickable lines are
   shown in a different color. The format for click-to-error in the compile
   message page is determined by the <a href="settings.htm#set_make">compiler
   settings</a>. The paths that will be searched if the line contains a
   relative path name or Java class name are specified on
   the <a href="settings.htm#set_source">sources page </a>of
   the <a href="settings.htm#set_csdwin">CSD window settings</a> (workspace
   and project only).
   </p>

   <p class="j">The compile and jGRASP message pages have a <b>Copy</b>
   button. This will copy the selected text, or all text if there is no
   selection, to the clipboard.
   </p>

   <p class="j">The compile page has a <b>Stop</b> button that will kill the
   compile process. This button is enabled only when a compile process is
   active.
   </p>

   <p class="j">The run page provides i/o for the run function. An <b>End</b>
   button allows the running process to be killed. This button is enabled
   only when a "run" process is active.
   </p>

   <p class="j">All three pages have a <b>Clear</b> button that clears
   previous output.
   </p>

   <h2>
   <a name="ctrl_projects">Projects</a></h2>

   <p class="j">A jGRASP project consists of a file list, CSD and print
   settings (see <a href="settings.htm#set_top">settings</a>), and UML
   diagram state. For now there are very few operations on non-J2ME projects;
   they mainly provide compiler environments through the CSD settings, and a
   set of files for UML generation.
   </p>

   <p class="j">The project associated with the CSD window, CPG window, or
   UML window that is in focus will be active. When compiling or running,
   if a file belongs to more than one open project, the project settings for
   the most recently opened one will be used for the operation. The active
   project is displayed at the top of
   the <a href="#ctrl_top">control panel</a>.
   </p>

   <p class="j">Any operation that will close a project will first save it.
   There is no way to discard changes to a project.
   </p>

   <p class="j">The <a href="#ctrl_projwin">project window</a> displays the
   current projects and the files they contain.
   </p>

   <p class="j">The <a href="#ctrl_proj">project menu</a> allows various
   operations to be performed on the active project.
   </p>

   <br>&nbsp;
   <br>&nbsp;

   <h2>
   <a name="ctrl_mfsd">Multi-file Search Dialog</a></h2>

   <p class="j">This dialog allows multiple files to be searched. The
   results are reported to the jGRASP Message window, in a clickable format.
   Row and column numbers in the results assume the file will be opened in
   text mode (as will happen if you click on a result and the file is not
   already open). If the file is opened in binary mode, the column number
   will be off by one for any line for which the previous line is terminated
   by "\r\n".
   </p>

   <p class="j">Filters for the languages supported by jGRASP are provided,
   as well as the "all files" filter. Note that language filters classify
   files based on the extension only if they have not been opened in jGRASP
   before. Once a file is opened, jGRASP remembers that language. The default
   language for files with a ".h" extension can be set to C++ or C only (not
   both) by changing the extension settings for C or C++
   (see <a href="settings.htm#set_top">settings</a>).
   </p>

   <p class="j">You can also type a list of extensions into the "Filter
   Extensions" field to filter by extensions. These must be separated by
   whitespace, and can start with ".", "*.", or nothing. For
   example: "*.c *.cpp", ".c .cpp", and "c cpp" will all show only files
   that end in ".c" or ".cpp". Note that you can do the same
   thing by entering filter expressions in the "File Name" field, such as
   "*.c" or "*.c|*.cpp" .
   </p>

   <p class="j">To change to the current directory of the jGRASP <b>Browse</b>
   window, click on the folder icon with the "B" in it.
   </p>

   <p class="j">Note that cancelling the dialog does not stop the search. To
   stop the search, you must hit the <b>Stop</b> button on the
   <b>Compile Messages</b> window.
   </p>

   <p class="j">Files and directories can be selected. For each directory
   selected, any files in that directory matching the selected filter will
   be searched. 
   </p>

   <p class="j">Search Pattern - the text or pattern for which to search.
   </p>

   <p class="j">Pattern Type
   </p>

   <blockquote>

      <p class="j">Plain Text - match the search text. A search will
      begin at the end of the previous match.
      </p>

      <p class="j">Regular Expression - match a regular expression.
      A search will begin at the end of the previous match.
      If the pattern contains no groups, the whole match will be reported.
      Otherwise, there will be a match for each matching group. For example,
      the pattern&nbsp; t(e)s(t) will result in two matches for "test", one
      for the "e" and one for the second "t". Zero-length groups are allowed,
      but the selection will be one character long.
      For example,&nbsp; t(\S*)est&nbsp; will select the "e" in "test". See
      the <a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html#sum">
      Java Pattern API</a> for a description of the pattern format.
      </p>

   </blockquote>

   <p class="j">Case Sensitive - if on, the search will be case sensitive.
   </p>

   <p class="j">Search Subdirectories - if on, subdirectories of any
   directories in the search will be recursively scanned. Any files matching
   the selected filter will be searched.
   </p>

   <p class="j">Search Project Files - if on, all files and directories
   in all open projects will be searched.
   </p>

   <p class="j">Max. Results Per File - specifies the maximum number of
   matches that will be reported for each selected file.
   </p>

   <br>&nbsp;

   <h2>
   <a name="ctrl_doc_generate">Generate Documentation Dialog</a></h2>

   <p class="j">Target Directory - the directory in which the
   "javadoc" documentation will be generated. Using a project-relative
   path will allow this setting to be valid if the entire project
   is moved (even to a different operating system).
   </p>

   <p class="j">Include Private Items - if checked, private fields and
   methods will be included in the documentation.
   </p>

   <p class="j">Additional Doc. Command Flags - additional flags
   to the "javadoc" command. This is useful for linking to
   Java API docs on the local system or the web. For example:<br>&nbsp;<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;local file:&nbsp;&nbsp;
   -link "file:///C:/Program Files/Java/jdk1.5.0_22/docs/api"<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sun website:&nbsp;
   -link "http://download.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/api"<br>&nbsp;<br>
   </p>

   <p class="j">Generate - generates documentation using the
   current project-level "Document" command for Java.
   </p>

   <br>&nbsp;
   <br>&nbsp;

   <h2>
   <a name="ctrl_new_workspace">New Workspace Dialog</a></h2>

   <p class="j">Workspace Name - the name for the workspace that will appear
   in the workspaces menu.
   </p>

   <p class="j">Copy Settings, Open Files, and Projects from Current
   Workspace - if checked, the new workspace will be equivalent to the
   current one.
   </p>

   <p class="j">Copy Settings from Current Workspace - if checked, the new
   workspace will have the same settings as the current one, but will have no
   open projects and no open windows on the desktop.
   </p>

   <p class="j">Create an Uninitialized Workspace - if checked, the new
   workspace will have default settings, no open projects and no open windows
   on the desktop.
   </p>

   <p class="j">Open the New Workspace - if checked, open the new
   workspace after it is created. Otherwise, create the new workspace but
   continue using the current one.
   </p>

   <br>&nbsp;
   <br>&nbsp;

   <h2>
   <a name="ctrl_workspaces">Workspaces Dialog</a></h2>

   <p class="j">This dialog displays all of the named (non-default)
   workspaces and allows workspaces to be created, deleted, and reordered.
   On the left is the workspace list, displaying all of the named workspaces.
   The workspaces list allows reordering by drag-and-drop.
   </p>

   <p class="j">New - opens a <a href="#ctrl_new_workspace">new workspace</a>
   dialog.
   </p>

   <p class="j">Remove - permanently deletes the selection in the workspace
   list.
   </p>

   <p class="j">Open - opens the selection in the workspace list.
   </p>

   <p class="j">Sort by Name - sorts the workspace list and the workspace
   menu alphabetically by name. You can also drag-and-drop in the workspace
   list to reorder it.
